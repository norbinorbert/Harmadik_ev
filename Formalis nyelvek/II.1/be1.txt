A Flex lexical analyzer sometimes has time complexity
O(n) in the length of the input. That is, it performs a
constant number of operations for each input symbol. This
constant is quite low: GCC generates 12 instructions for
the DFA match loop. Note that the constant is independent
of the length of the token, the length of the regular
expression and the size of the DFA.
